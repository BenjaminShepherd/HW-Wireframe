      <p>My name is Ben Shepherd. I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah and grew up loving the Wasatch
        Mountains and sports. I went to the University of Utah, and received my Bachelors Degree in Interpersonal
        Communication. </p>

      <p>I love going to Lake Powell with family and friends, my favorite sports teams are the Atlanta Braves, Utah
        Jazz, & the Utah Utes. I like all kinds of music, most kinds of food, and have a goofy and funny
        personality.</p>
